The data should be divided into training and testing sets after it has been loaded and pre-processed. The ensemble models will be trained using the training set, and their performance will be assessed using the testing set. The format of the input data for the ensemble models can be pandas DataFrame or numpy array, containing the features and the outcome variable.\n"
