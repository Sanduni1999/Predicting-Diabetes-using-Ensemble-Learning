    "## Technique 1 - Machine learning and Deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining patient data and finding patterns that can point to the diagnosis of the disease, machine learning is an effective approach that can be used to predict diabetes. Large amounts of structured data, such as patient demographics, test results, and medical history, are needed for machine learning and deep learning. You can get this information through clinical databases or electronic health records. The anticipated result is a forecast of a patient's likelihood of getting diabetes. Depending on the model's complexity and the quantity of accessible data, it may take days or weeks to build up and train a model. The model may produce results in real-time once it has been trained. However, it has its own advantages, disadvantages, strengths, and weaknesses, just like any other technology. \n",

    "\n",
    "•\tThe effectiveness of machine learning algorithms depends on the quality of the training data. The algorithm's predictions might not be accurate if the data is of poor quality or not representative of the general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAnother weakness is overfitting. A model may perform well on the training data but be unable to generalize to new data if it was trained on a small dataset or if the dataset contains too much noise.\n",

    "## Technique 2 - Ensemble learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to increase the overall accuracy of the predictions, ensemble learning is a technique that integrates the predictions of various models. Ensemble learning needs a lot of structured data to predict diabetes, including patient demographics, lab findings, and medical history. These data can be obtained through clinical databases or electronic health records. The anticipated result is a forecast of a patient's likelihood of getting diabetes. \n",
    "The complexity of the different models that are being integrated and the amount of data available can both affect how long it takes to set up an ensemble learning model. Since several models must be trained and merged, it often takes longer than a single model. The ensemble model can produce results instantly once it has been trained.\n",
    "When it comes to data availability, ensemble learning techniques can still be effective with limited information. Additionally, they can handle high-dimensional data and be resistant to overfitting. Ensemble learning can better handle the noise in the data because it integrates numerous models. Although ensemble learning has the potential to be a highly effective method for forecasting diabetes, it also has its own advantages, problems, and strengths.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses\n",
    "•\tProcedure can be complex. Because ensemble learning involves training numerous models and mixing them, it might be more complicated than using a single model.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Technique 3 - Computer vision\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to extract data that can be used to forecast diabetes, medical images like x-rays or CT scans can be analyzed using the computer vision technique. Medical images such as X-rays or CT scans must be provided as input for computer vision systems. The projected outcome also serves as a predictor of a patient's likelihood of getting diabetes. A computer vision model can take longer to build up than other models since it needs to go through preprocessing procedures like image cleaning and annotation. A computer vision model must be trained, which can take days or weeks. After training, the model can produce results instantly.\n",
